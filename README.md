BACKUP
=======
This is a scipt for backing up folders/files quickly, cleanly and efficently.
By outputing the files into a compressed/uncompressed "tar.gz" or ".zip" file. 
These backups are then saved into a local folder called "Backups" where all of your timestamped backups are #located and managed.
